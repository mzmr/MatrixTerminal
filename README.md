Matrix Terminal
===============

This program displays the well-known animation of falling characters in the terminal. I've tried to make it similar to the one from the Matrix film.

Though this is the C++ program, you can't compile it on Linux because it uses Windows API to manipulate the terminal window.

Enjoy!
